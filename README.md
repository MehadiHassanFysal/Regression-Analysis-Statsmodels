## 📈 Regression Analysis for Empirical Research (Python)

This repository contains Python-based regression analyses with an emphasis on **statistical inference rather than prediction**. The projects use **Statsmodels and Scikit-learn** to demonstrate how regression techniques are applied in empirical business and social science research.

### Contents

#### 1. Simple Linear Regression

Implements simple linear regression to examine relationships between variables, focusing on coefficient interpretation, statistical significance, and model assumptions.

#### 2. Multiple Linear Regression

Extends regression analysis to multiple predictors, emphasizing inference, multicollinearity considerations, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

#### 3. Regularized Regression (Lasso & Ridge)

Applies Lasso and Ridge regression to illustrate regularization, bias–variance tradeoffs, and coefficient shrinkage in high-dimensional settings.

#### 4. Logistic Regression

Uses binary logistic regression for classification-style outcomes, with emphasis on interpretation of coefficients and odds ratios rather than model tuning.

### Skills Demonstrated

* Regression modeling for inference
* Hypothesis-driven statistical analysis
* Interpretation of coefficients and p-values
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)

This repository highlights **core quantitative methods** commonly used in Information Systems, management, and applied social science research.
